      Matlab integration of AUTO for dynamical systems analysis
    </div>

    <p>Background

This is a MATLAB version of AUTO, where we have integrated AUTO into MATLAB via mex functions. One of the biggest reasons why Dynamical Systems Theory is not being applied in an engineering context, is mainly due to the lack of bifurcation software that integrates with relative ease with existing toolsets. Ample examples are also needed for a person new to the field. We therefore tried to address this by incorporating AUTO into MATLAB, and thus the Dynamical Sytems Toolbox was built. We hope that it would be useful teaching tool and can help popularise the methods amongst the engineering community.

At this stage we are still in the process of adding several engineering examples to the toolbox . Feel free to develop some examples for inclusion into the toolbox. There are template files that you can use for inclusion of your own examples.

Authors

This toolbox was written by Etienne Coetzee, Phani Thota and James Rankin from the University of Bristol. Obviously, credit must also be given to the authors of AUTO, Esebius Doedel et al.

Main features

•Look and feel of MATLAB. 
•Extensive use of objects. 
•Can be run in the new mode, or still with all the old AUTO files (.c,.7,.8.9) familiar to the user. 
•Robust error checking. 
•Additional outputs can be detected and also passed out to MATLAB variables. 
•Any of the MATLAB toolsets can be used, i.e. the Symbolic toolbox, Simulink etc. 
•Similar notations to that of AUTO. A person familiar with AUTO should find it straightforward to pick up the new toolsets. 
•Also works with the student version of MATLAB. 
•Ample documentation. 
•Templates files for people willing to contribute their own examples for inclusion into the demos. 
Drawbacks

•Limit Cycles are at least an order of magnitude slower. We had to make a trade-off between robustness and speed. We therefore decided that if we want to popularise the methods, then the code should work, and people should not have to struggle with decoding it. 
•No ample enginering examples yet.
</p><h2>Install</h2>
<p>1.Download the toolbox and unzip. 
2.Open MATLAB and change to the directory where the toolbox was unzipped. 
3.Run the program  installdynasys.m; A user interface will appear. 
4.If you have admin rights keep the default values and install. The toolbox will be installed in the MATLAB installation directory. 
5.If you do not have admin rights, install the toolbox to a directory where you have access rights. A startup.m file will be created in this directory. 
6.Close MATLAB, and restart. 
7.Type dynasysroot and dynasyshelproot at the command line. If these commands are working, it should indicate where the toolbox components were installed. If not, something has gone wrong. Check that the paths are correctly defined. 
8.The Dynamical Systems Toolbox should appear on the menu. If not, either the paths were not defined correctly, or the info.xml file in the $dynasysroot/toolbox/dynasys directory has the wrong information on line 10. Add the correct path to the documentation directory $dynasysdocroot/toolbox/dynasys. 
9.Close MATLAB and restart.
